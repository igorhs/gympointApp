# gympointApp
This application was built with Node.js using Express and the Sucrase + Nodemon, ESLint + Prettier + EditorConfig, Sequelize (PostgreSQL) tools.

Authentication through JWT and data validation were applied on Login session;

Concepts of Seed in migrations were also applied because only authenticated administrators can include new users.

So, I used this admin to make tests.
